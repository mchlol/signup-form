# signup-form (WIP)
Intermediate HTML & CSS project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form)  

[Live](https://mchlol.github.io/signup-form/)  

## Challenge

Follow a design brief  
Create and style a form with validation  
Use CSS positioning  

### Notes

- You CAN link a button to a form even when it is outside of the form element - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_form.asp)
- This would have been a good opportunity to use TailwindCSS.  
- Validation is done with classes so is not correct - as per project instructions I have used classes only for the purposes of this exercise.
